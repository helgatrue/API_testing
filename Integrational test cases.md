### ⭐ Suggestions for improvement
- Implement a full logging approach to support debugging and auditing.
- Expand monitoring capabilities to detect anomalies and performance degradation in real time.
- Implement a reliable disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime and data loss in case of system failures.


### 🤝 Integration with Jenkins pipeline
Details are [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/testing/).

1. **To get started, ensure that the following is installed on your test computer**
- Jenkins v2.456 or later
- TestComplete (or TestExecute)
- The application is under test. In the case of web applications, install all the required browsers

2. **Go to the Jenkins Plugin Manager and install the `TestComplete Support` plugin.**

The plugin provides an easy-to-use and flexible UI to configure your TestComplete project to run in your CI process. Once this is done, restart the Jenkins server for the changes to come into effect.

3. **Prepare the testing environment.**

For tests to be able to simulate user actions on the UI, an interactive session must be opened on the test machine. 

4. **Configure your Jenkins agents.**

Ensure that your Jenkins agent is set up to run in interactive mode. If the agent is running as a Windows application under a user account, you are good. However, if your Jenkins agent is running as a service, you need to configure it to run under the Local System User account and then open a user session via the plugin.
